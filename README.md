# SQL ORM
An ORM — object-relational mapping – is a technique in OOP that allows us to interact with a SQL database in Java. 
Usually, it's easier to use a ORM to interact with a SQL database than to write raw queries ourselves. With this tool,
we can easily insert, delete, search, and select data from a SQL database using a langauge we already know.
